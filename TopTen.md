# Introduction #

A function that finds top 10 items in an array of integers, in the descending order. If the original array has less than 10 items, the result array will be of the same size.


# Code #
Note that **sort** creates a sorted sequence (not an array), and **list** creates an array filled with the first 10 items of the sequence:

```
top10 = { arr: [integer] -> list (sort x, y in arr that x >= y?) to 10 }!
```
